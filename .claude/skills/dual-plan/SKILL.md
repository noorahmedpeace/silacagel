description: Plan and build a feature with Claude AND OpenAI Codex together — Claude drafts the implementation plan, Codex critiques it against the codebase, Claude merges and implements after user approval, then /dual-review gates the merge. Use when the user says "dual plan", "plan with both", "plan this with ChatGPT/Codex", or wants both models on a feature.

# Dual plan (Claude + Codex/ChatGPT)

Feature workflow with two models: Claude drives, Codex independently
critiques at two gates — the plan and the final diff. The value is
adversarial: Codex is prompted to find what the plan gets wrong, not to
agree with it.

## Steps

1. **Scope the feature.** Explore the codebase as usual (respect the repo's
   CLAUDE.md conventions and known landmines). Draft an implementation plan:
   goal, files to touch, approach, data-shape changes, risks, test plan.
   Write it to a scratchpad file OUTSIDE the repo (e.g. `/tmp/plan.md`) —
   scratch files inside the repo would pollute the later `--uncommitted`
   review scope or get committed by accident.

2. **Codex critique gate.** Build a critique prompt file containing the plan
   plus instructions, then run Codex read-only in the background (takes
   minutes):

   ```bash
   codex exec -s read-only -c model_reasoning_effort="high" - < /tmp/critique-prompt.md
   ```

   Pass `-s read-only` explicitly — the user's config may default to a
   write-enabled sandbox, and the critic must never touch the tree.

   Critique prompt template:
   > You are reviewing an implementation plan for this repository (read the
   > code to check every claim; AGENTS.md — or CLAUDE.md if there is no
   > AGENTS.md — has project context, when present). Do NOT
   > implement anything. Find: (1) factually wrong assumptions about the
   > codebase, (2) missed files, call sites, or cross-repo blast radius,
   > (3) simpler alternatives, (4) risks/edge cases the plan ignores,
   > (5) anything in the test plan that wouldn't catch a regression.
   > Be specific — cite file paths. Then give an overall verdict:
   > SOUND / NEEDS-CHANGES with a ranked list.
   >
   > PLAN: <plan.md contents>

3. **Adjudicate and revise.** For each Codex critique point: accept (revise
   the plan) or reject (verify against the code first; never dismiss
   unchecked).

4. **Converge — Codex must sign off on the FINAL plan.** Send the revised
   plan back to Codex for re-critique (same prompt template, plus a
   "previous round's points and how each was addressed or rebutted"
   section). Repeat revise → re-critique until Codex returns **SOUND**, up
   to **3 rounds** total. Do not present a plan to the user that Codex has
   not seen in its final form.
   - If Codex still says NEEDS-CHANGES after round 3, stop looping: present
     the plan WITH the unresolved disagreement as a named decision point —
     each side's position and your recommendation — and let the user rule.
     Never paper over a disagreement to fake consensus, and never keep
     looping past 3 rounds (models can trade nits forever).

5. **User approval.** Present the converged plan with a short "what Codex
   changed / how many rounds" section — the user approves before any code
   is written.

6. **Implement.** Claude writes the code (Claude holds the tools, memory,
   and repo context). Codex does not edit the working tree — two writers on
   one tree causes conflicts.

7. **Close with /dual-review** (the sibling skill) on the finished diff
   before any PR/merge.

## Advanced: Codex as co-coder (only when the user asks)

For a large feature with a cleanly separable piece, Codex can implement that
piece itself in an ISOLATED git worktree:

```bash
git worktree add /tmp/codex-<feature> HEAD
cd /tmp/codex-<feature> && codex exec --sandbox workspace-write "<subtask spec>"
```

Then Claude reviews Codex's working-tree diff in the worktree, applies and
commits the accepted changes onto the main branch, and /dual-review still
gates the combined result. Never point a write-enabled Codex at the user's
primary working tree.

## Notes

- Same plumbing as /dual-review: OpenAI Codex CLI installed + authenticated;
  don't edit the user's `~/.codex/config.toml` — always override reasoning
  effort to `high` via `-c`, and check which model the config pins (a mini
  model gives shallow critiques; override via `-c model=...` if needed).
  macOS + Codex desktop app: if `codex` is symlinked out of
  `/Applications/Codex.app`, its sibling helper `codex-code-mode-host` must
  be symlinked into the same directory too, or every run fails with "failed
  to spawn code-mode host" — recreate both symlinks if you hit that.
- Always pass `-s read-only` on critique runs — don't rely on the sandbox
  default, which the user's config can change. Only the explicit co-coder
  flow uses `--sandbox workspace-write`, and only in a worktree.
- Run Codex calls via Bash `run_in_background: true`; do other work while
  waiting.
