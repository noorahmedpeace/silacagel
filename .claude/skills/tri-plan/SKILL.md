description: Plan a feature with Claude, OpenAI Codex, AND Google Gemini together — Claude drafts the implementation plan, Codex and Gemini independently critique it against the codebase in parallel, Claude adjudicates and implements after user approval, then /tri-review gates the merge. Use when the user says "tri plan", "triple plan", "plan with all three", or wants maximum independent scrutiny on a plan before code is written.

# Tri plan (Claude + Codex + Gemini)

Feature workflow with three models: Claude drives, Codex and Gemini
independently critique at two gates — the plan and (via /tri-review) the
final diff. The value is adversarial and cross-vendor: both critics are
prompted to find what the plan gets wrong, not to agree with it, and a
point BOTH critics raise independently is near-certain to be real.

## Steps

1. **Scope the feature.** Explore the codebase as usual (respect the repo's
   CLAUDE.md conventions and known landmines). Draft an implementation plan:
   goal, files to touch, approach, data-shape changes, risks, test plan.
   Write it to a scratch file OUTSIDE the repo (`mktemp -t plan.XXXXXX.md`) —
   scratch files inside the repo would pollute a later `--uncommitted`
   review scope or get committed by accident. Both critics read this file,
   so use an absolute path.

2. **Critique gate — run both critics in parallel, in the background**
   (each takes minutes; two separate Bash calls with
   `run_in_background: true`):

   ```bash
   codex exec -s read-only -c model_reasoning_effort="high" - < /path/to/critique-prompt.md
   ```

   ```bash
   cat /path/to/plan.md | gemini --skip-trust --approval-mode plan -p "<critique prompt; the plan is the text above>"
   ```

   Pass `-s read-only` (Codex) and `--skip-trust --approval-mode plan`
   (Gemini) explicitly — a critic must never touch the tree. The plan is
   piped into Gemini via stdin (`gemini -p` appends stdin to the prompt), so
   no file-read tool is needed.

   Critique prompt template (same content for both critics; for Gemini, the
   plan text arrives on stdin ahead of the prompt):
   > You are reviewing an implementation plan for this repository (read the
   > code to check every claim; AGENTS.md — or CLAUDE.md if there is no
   > AGENTS.md — has project context, when present). Do NOT implement
   > anything, do NOT edit files. Verify the plan's claims against the
   > files and symbols it names — do not do an open-ended tour of the repo.
   > Find: (1) factually wrong assumptions about the codebase, (2) missed
   > files, call sites, or cross-repo blast radius, (3) simpler
   > alternatives, (4) risks/edge cases the plan ignores, (5) anything in
   > the test plan that wouldn't catch a regression. Be specific — cite
   > file paths. Then give an overall verdict: SOUND / NEEDS-CHANGES with a
   > ranked list.
   >
   > PLAN: <plan contents / path>

   The "verify, don't tour" line matters for Gemini especially — an
   unconstrained agent wanders the repo and exceeds `--print-timeout` with
   no output.

3. **Merge and adjudicate.** Dedupe the two critique lists, then:
   - **Both critics raised it**: treat as near-certain — revise the plan
     (only reject with strong code evidence, stated in the round notes).
   - **One critic raised it**: verify against the code first; accept
     (revise) or reject with the reason. Never dismiss unchecked, and
     never relay one model's claim into the plan unverified.

4. **Converge — BOTH critics must sign off on the FINAL plan.** Send the
   revised plan back to both in parallel (same prompt template, plus a
   "previous round's points and how each was addressed or rebutted"
   section). Repeat revise → re-critique until both return **SOUND**, up to
   **3 rounds** total — the cap is shared, not per-critic. Do not present a
   plan to the user that either critic has not seen in its final form.
   - If either critic still says NEEDS-CHANGES after round 3, stop looping:
     present the plan WITH each unresolved disagreement as a named decision
     point — who holds which position and your recommendation — and let the
     user rule. Never paper over a disagreement to fake consensus, and
     never keep looping past 3 rounds (models can trade nits forever).
   - A critic that keeps raising NEW nits each round (rather than defending
     old ones) is churning, not converging — after round 3 that also goes
     to the user as-is.

5. **User approval.** Present the converged plan with a short "what each
   critic changed / how many rounds / any [disputed] points" section — the
   user approves before any code is written.

6. **Implement.** Claude writes the code (Claude holds the tools, memory,
   and repo context). Neither critic edits the working tree — multiple
   writers on one tree causes conflicts.

7. **Close with /tri-review** (the sibling skill) on the finished diff
   before any PR/merge.

## Notes

- Plumbing is shared with the sibling skills — see **/dual-review's Notes**
  for the Codex leg (install/auth, `codex-code-mode-host` symlink trap,
  model pinned in `~/.codex/config.toml`, always `-c
  model_reasoning_effort="high"`) and **/tri-review's Notes** for the
  Gemini leg (Gemini CLI + API key in `~/.gemini/.env`, pipe the input via
  stdin, `--skip-trust --approval-mode plan`, keep the leg on a **Gemini**
  model so two of three critics aren't from the same lab).
- Checking a plan's claims takes more reading than reviewing a patch, so
  give the Gemini critic ample time (the CLI's default print timeout is
  generous; raise it with the env/flag if a run is cut off).
- If one critic CLI is unavailable (not installed / auth broken), say so
  and offer to fall back to /dual-plan rather than silently running with
  one critic under a three-critic banner.
- The co-coder variant (a critic implementing a separable piece in an
  isolated worktree) is documented in /dual-plan — it applies unchanged;
  use it only when the user asks.
